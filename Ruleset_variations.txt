The first option is always the default one.

1. [paradox_action] Reaching a paradox results in:
     a) [permanent_removal] 'Auditors of Reality': Variations of deactivating stones on setup are tried in a specific order (prioritizing an arbitrary ordering, see below) until a causally-consistent scenario is possible. Setup stones deactivated this way stay deactivated for the rest of the game, even if, in future canonizations, their reoccurence would be causally consistent.
     b) [temporary_removal] 'Vacation in Time': Same as 'Auditors of reality', except the stones are not removed permanently and their re-activation is considered in every canonization.
     c) [game_end] 'Know your paradoxes!': A paradox immediately ends the game!

2. [end_without_win] If the game ends with no players satisfying the primary win condition,
     a) [draw] 'Poiccard's Gambit': The game counts as a draw.
     b) [win_by_points] 'Fighting in the War Room': If one player owns the majority of bases in the final timeslice of the last canonized round, that player wins the game.

3. [scenario_priority] If a paradox is reached and two or more variations of setup stone deactivations are causally consistent, what criterions are used to trim down the number of variations to choose from?
     a) [conserve_setup] 'Shield and Spear': 1. Smaller number of setup deactivations is prioritized; 2. Not deactivating setup stones more recently touched by the player is prioritized; 3. Keeping effects added more recently active is prioritized.
     b) [activity_interaction_recency] 'Ace Wildcard': 1. Not deactivating stones (setup or TJI) more recently touched by the player is prioritized; 2. Keeping effects added more recently active is prioritized.
     c) [conserve_effects_stones_hc] 'Merry Chronos': 1. Bigger number of active effects is prioritized; 2. Bigger number of stones present on board is prioritized; 3. Keeping more recently added stones is prioritized (where the recency of setup stones is determined in first round by a headcount by each player); 4. Keeping actions added more recently active is prioritized.

   If we select 'Know your paradoxes!' for Q1, the options for 3 change to
     a) [all_setup_activity_recency] 'Out with the Old': Keeping effects added more recently active is prioritized.
     b) [all_setup_conserve_effects] 'Conservative': 1. Bigger number of active effects is prioritized; 2. Keeping effects added more recently active is prioritized.
