The first option is always the default one.

1. Reaching a paradox results in:
     a) 'Auditors of Reality': Variations of deactivating stones on setup are tried in a specific order (prioritizing an arbitrary ordering, see below) until a causally-consistent scenario is possible. Setup stones deactivated this way stay deactivated for the rest of the game, even if, in future canonizations, their reoccurence would be causally consistent.
     b) 'Vacation in Time': Same as 'Auditors of reality', except the stones are not removed permanently and their re-activation is considered in every canonization.
     c) 'Know your paradoxes!': A paradox immediately ends the game!

2. If the game ends with no players satisfying the primary win condition,
     a) 'Poiccard's Gambit': The game counts as a draw.
     b) 'Fighting in the War Room': If one player owns the majority of bases in the final timeslice of the last canonized round, that player wins the game.

3. If a paradox is reached and two or more variations of setup stone deactivations are causally consistent, what criterions are used to trim down the number of variations to choose from?
     a) 'Shield and Spear': 1. Smaller number of setup deactivations is prioritized; 2. Not deactivating stones more recently touched by the player is prioritized; 3. Keeping TJIs added more recently active is prioritized.
     b) 'Ace Wildcard': 1. Keeping TJIs added more recently active is prioritized; 2. Not deactivating stones more recently touched by the player is prioritized; 3. Smaller number of setup deactivations is prioritized.
     c) 'Merry Chronos': 1. Bigger number of active TJIs is prioritized; 2. Bigger number of stones present on board is prioritized; 3. Keeping more recently added stones is prioritized (where the recency of setup stones is determined in first round by a headcount by each player).
