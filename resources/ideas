normally:
    you move all your stones from t=0 to t=T. Then by one you add their time jumps.

flags:
    dark map: you only see certain squares
    PTSD: you can do a move "time jump" which prematurely ends the stone's path, as if its T was smaller
    open timeline: (automatically flags PTSD): there is no automatic time jump activation and the timeline is infinite, but you can only jump by a certain amount of seconds



proposed change:
storing stones:
    player A:
        [
            0: [stone1, stone1_kid, stone1_grandkid...]
            1: [stone2, stone2_kid, stone2_grandkid...]
        ]
        
        
give the player the option to view a paradox to play out ("why didnt this happen as i planned it??")
