# TANK
-Classic

# SNIPER
-Doesn't move on its own, can only be sokoban-pushed (of course, can turn to change azimuth)
-Opposable

-Can time jump any time


# TAGGER
-Jumps like a horse
-Unopposable (jumps over stones)
-Attacks by deploying a tagscreen
-Tagscreen explodes one turn later, tagging stones on the 4 adjanced squares
-Tagged stones cannot time-jump anymore, and become causally locked in the final time-slice
-Friendly fire off, but the Tagger itself cannot be affected by tagscreens (not even by other Taggers) (NOTE: maybe not? so that there's a pressure for him to escape)
-Can only time jump after reaching the end of the round


# WILDCARD
-Moves in 8 directions by 1 horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
-Unopposable (jumps over stones)
-Attacks a selected adjanced square
-Friendly fire on
-Can time jump any time
-Cannot conquer bases (fun board where one tank and many wildcards so if the tank dies they have to downgrade to be able to win the game)
-SPECIAL: Can adopt a time-jump-in of any stone type (i.e. can retroactively become a different stone which is time-jumping-in)
