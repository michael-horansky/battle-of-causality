# TANK
-Classic
-Tank controls
-Opposable
-Attacks by firing in line of sight
-Friendly fire on
-Can only time jump after reaching the end of round


# BOMBARDIER
-Moves in 4 cardinal directions by 1
-Opposable
-Attacks by dropping bombs which destroy a larger area back in time
-Friendly fire on
-Can only time jump after reaching the end of round


# SNIPER
-Doesn't move on its own, can only be sokoban-pushed (of course, can turn to change azimuth)
-Opposable
-Attacks by firing in line of sight
-Friendly fire off
-Can time jump any time


# TAGGER
-Jumps like a horse
-Cannot wait! (so that movement is less easy, requires 3D planning)
-Unopposable (jumps over stones)
-Attacks by deploying a tagscreen
-Tagscreen explodes one turn later, tagging stones on the 4 adjanced squares
-Tagged stones cannot time-jump anymore, and become causally locked in the final time-slice
-Friendly fire off, but the Tagger itself cannot be affected by tagscreens (not even by other Taggers) (NOTE: maybe not? so that there's a pressure for him to escape)
-Can only time jump like a horsey

NOTE: Ideas for other effects of the tagscreen in case timejump blocking is not fun:
    a) Teleports all stones forward
    b) Support function: the tagscreen serves as a "free interference", setting the flag_ID_max for tagged stones to current round, so they become causally free again.

NOTE: idea for movement: to make interference easier, how about the tagger has a "wait"-like movement option which makes it unpushable? or maybe some other stone?
nah: interference is easy with the unlock tag


# WILDCARD
-Moves in 4 diagonal directions by 1
-Unopposable (jumps over stones)
-Attacks on movement as if capturing in chess (i.e. becomes a mine which destroys all on the same square except self, but only on movement, not waiting or timejumping)
-Friendly fire on
-Can time jump any time
-Cannot conquer bases (fun board where one tank and many wildcards so if the tank dies they have to downgrade to be able to win the game)
-SPECIAL: Can adopt a time-jump-in of any stone type (i.e. can retroactively become a different stone which is time-jumping-in)
