# battle-of-causality
## Introduction
Battle of Causality is a turn-based digital strategy board game with time travel. Two players control their armies in the goal of capturing all of the opponent's bases, for which they utilize various types of game pieces (stones), including the ability to send them back in time.

## How can I play?
The game is currently hosted at http://www.siqo.sk/boc (NOTE: work in progress). In order to play, you go to the website, create a free account (in the future anonymous games will be available, too), and you're free to start playing games with other users. A detailed manual for how to use the page can be found over there.

To get started, you can read the rulebook, which can be found in the meta/ subfolder of this repository.

## What is this repository?
This is the development version of Battle of Causality, containing no web services. There does exist a local text-based user interface, but it isn't the most suitable to play this game. What this repository is, however, is a template for you to fork it and create your own flavour of Battle of Causality under the GPL-3.0 license. This repository does provide client methods to access and save the game, which means it can be linked to any form of file sharing to create the full multiplayer experience, be it online or within a LAN etc.
